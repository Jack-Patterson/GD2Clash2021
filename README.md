# Games Development Project - Clash of Clans

This project was created using *Unity* for my **Games Developemnt Project** done during the first semester course of second year in college. The aim with this project was to create a part of the game *Clash of Clans*. While it was never completed we were given individual parts in which to practice our skills at Games Development.

## Assignment
### Main Menu
I only took part in building the *Archer Tower* which had a person who stood on top of it and fired projectiles at an enemy below. I also made edits to the *Unit* and *Building* script which the *Archer Tower* would fall under.
